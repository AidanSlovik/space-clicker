# space-clicker

I am making a clicker game with a button that is upgradeable and random events.  
there will also be a way to buy idle upgrades that constantly increase your points.  
I will use pygame for graphics for my game.  

I have not started on any work with graphics.

## My game has 3 classes:  
1. A main class with most of the code  
2. An upgrade class with a function to create upgrades with different costs and effects  
3. A random event class that will create random events that can help the user
